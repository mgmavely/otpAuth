# otpAuth
Sample OTPAuthenticator using twilio and python scripts

NOTE: twillvar.py file is ommitted as it contains private details
to twilio account, which one would need to input themselves.  For consistency
with variables used in pyScript.py, make twilVar.py as follows:
import os
from twilio.rest import Client

acc_sid = '[insert account SID here]'
auth_tok = '[insert account authentication token here]'
twilNum = '[insert twilio phone number here]'
client = Client(acc_sid,auth_tok)

if done correctly and both files are placed in the same directory, running the
pyscript.py file should send the authentication code to the inputted number
and run as desired.
